# Cards
A exercise in learning OOP in Python

## About the Project

As I continued to learn more and more about programming, I discovered the concept of object oriented programming and decided it would be worth my time to learn those concepts in Python more thoroughly. This project was a fun exercise in just that.

Programing a deck of cards in python is a great way to learn some of the concepts of OOP. A single playing card has two main attributes: suit and value. A deck is composed of 52 card objects and can have various methods like shuffling the deck or drawing a card from the top of the deck. I was even able to use inheritance, magic methods, and property decorators in this exercise.

I don't really know if what I've done is the best or most conventional way of OOP in python, but it's functional.

## Learning Goals

Primarily, I wanted to learn how object oriented programming works in python. My goals were as follows:

- Familiarize myself with creating objects and using instances in a python program
- Understand the syntax and process of defining a custom class and its behavior
- Modify the behavior of a custom class using the __init__() method and other magic methods in python
- Use inheritance to better organize my code

## About the Code

The code for this little program isnâ€™t too complicated. There are a few custom classes each with their own instance varibales and attributes.

### The Card Class

*class* `cards.Card(value, suit, hidden=False)`

This class represents a standard playing card. The card can also be hidden from view if needed.

Example:

    >>> from cards import Card
    >>> card = Card(1, 'Spades') # An ace of Spades 
    >>> card.show()
    Ace of Spades
    >>> card.hidden = True
    >>> card.show()
    This card is hidden.


Parameters:
- **value** (int) - The value of the card. For a standard deck of playing cards, 1 is ace, 11 is Jack, 12 is Queen, and 13 is King.
- **suit** (str) - The suit of the card. Generally, the four suits are `'Spades'`, `'Hearts'`, `'Diamonds'`, and `'Clubs'`.
- **hidden** (bool) - If `False` (the default), details aobut the card can be printed to the screen. If `True`, the information about the card cannot be printed to the terminal.

`show()`

Prints information about the card to the terminal. If `hidden` is False, prints the value and the suit of the card. If `hidden` is True, this methond prints 'This card is hidden.' to the terminal.

**changeHidden**(*hidden=none*)

Changes the value of `hidden`. 

Returns the same card instance that called the method

Parameters:
- **hidden** (bool) - The value that `hidden` is changed to. If `None`, flips to the opposite value.

**Other Notes:**

This class also implements the ordering magic methods. Only the `value` of the card object is used in determining an order.

Example:

    >>> card_a = Card(3, 'Hearts')
    >>> card_b = Card(8, 'Diamonds')
    >>> card_a == card_b
    False
    >>> card_a < card_b
    True
    >>> card_c = Card(3, 'Spades')
    >>> card_a == card_c
    True

### The Collection Class

*class* `cards.Collection(value, suit, hidden=False)`



### The Deck Class

The Deck class describes a deck of playing cards. Because a Deck object inharits from the Collection Class, it only needs two additional methods. One methong, `build`, fills the deck with the 52 standard playing cards. The other method, `reset`, resets the deck with the original 52 playing cards.

## Running the Program

The best way (really, the only way) to interact with this program is using the interactive shell and importing the cards module.

```
>>> from cards import *
```

Once the module in imported, we can create a Card instance and play around a bit.

Note, the `changeHidden` method in the Card class returns the instance that calls it.

```
>>> card = Card(4, 'Hearts')
>>> card.show()
4 of Hearts
>>> card.changeHidden()
<cards.Card object at 0x10ba1fe10>
>>> card.show()
This card is hidden.
```

We can paly around with a Deck object.

```
>>> deck = Deck()
>>> deck.show()
